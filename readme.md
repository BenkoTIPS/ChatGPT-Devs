In this session, you will learn how to work with ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. It will cover the basics of ChatGPT, including how it works and how it can be integrated into various applications. We will also explore the potential use cases for ChatGPT, including natural language processing, conversational AI, and more.
