# ChatGPT for Developers

In this session, you will learn how to work with ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. It will cover the basics of ChatGPT, including how it works and how it can be integrated into various applications. We will also explore the potential use cases for ChatGPT, including natural language processing, conversational AI, and more. Attendees will be guided through a series of demos that illustrate how to work with ChatGPT in a hands-on manner, using tools such as GitHub and ASP.NET Core.

## What is ChatGpt

Chat GPT is a language model that can be used to generate text. It is trained on a large corpus of text, and then it can be used to generate new text that is similar to the original corpus. The model was trained on a dataset of 8 million Reddit comments, and it can be used to generate text that is similar to the original dataset.
