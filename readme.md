# ChatGPT for Developers

In this session, you will learn how to work with ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. It will cover the basics of ChatGPT, including how it works and how it can be integrated into various applications. We will also explore the potential use cases for ChatGPT, including natural language processing, conversational AI, and more. Attendees will be guided through a series of demos that illustrate how to work with ChatGPT in a hands-on manner, using tools such as GitHub and ASP.NET Core.

## Copilot is your pair programmer

It works with you to write code, fast. So you can spend less time on the tedious parts and more time on the fun parts. Copilot draws context from the code you’re working on, suggesting whole lines or entire functions. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet. Copilot suggests code as you type, auto-completing entire lines at a time. It also draws from comments and code summaries to suggest contextually relevant code. Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a new AI system created by OpenAI. OpenAI Codex is a descendant of GPT-3 and has been trained on a selection of English language and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub. OpenAI Codex is exclusively licensed to GitHub.

## Containers

Containers asre used to run the code in a consistent environment. The container is built using the Dockerfile in the root of the repository. The container is built using the following command:


# We will deploy this with Terraform
