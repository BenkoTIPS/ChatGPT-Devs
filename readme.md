# ChatGPT for Developers

In this session, you will learn how to work with ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. It will cover the basics of ChatGPT, including how it works and how it can be integrated into various applications. We will also explore the potential use cases for ChatGPT, including natural language processing, conversational AI, and more. Attendees will be guided through a series of demos that illustrate how to work with ChatGPT in a hands-on manner, using tools such as GitHub and ASP.NET Core.

## About Copilot

copilot is a tool that helps you write better code faster. It uses machine learning to suggest whole lines or entire functions right inside your editor. Training on billions of lines of public code, GitHub Copilot puts the knowledge you need at your fingertips, saving you time and helping you stay focused.

## about containers and Kubernetes

Containers are a lightweight, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure. Containers are portable and scalable, making it easy to move applications from one host environment to another (for example, from on-premises environments to the cloud, or from a cloud environment back to on-premises). Containers are also ephemeral, which means they can be spun up and spun down quickly, providing fast and efficient application scaling.

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

## About the demo

In this demo we are going to build an application that uses copilot to generate code for us. We will use the generated code to create a containerized application and deploy it to kubernetes. The application will be a simple chat application that uses ChatGPT to generate chat messages.
