# ChatGPT for Developers

In this session, you will learn how to work with ChatGPT, a cutting-edge language model developed by OpenAI. It will cover the basics of ChatGPT, including how it works and how it can be integrated into various applications. We will also explore the potential use cases for ChatGPT, including natural language processing, conversational AI, and more. Attendees will be guided through a series of demos that illustrate how to work with ChatGPT in a hands-on manner, using tools such as GitHub and ASP.NET Core.

## What are language models?

Language models are a type of artificial intelligence that can generate human-like text. They are trained on huge amounts of data and can produce text that is indistinguishable from human-generated text. Language models have been used in many applications, including chatbots and other conversational AI applications.

## ChatGpt defined

Large Language Models (LLM) are a type of artificial intelligence that can generate human-like text. They are trained on huge amounts of data and can produce text that is indistinguishable from human-generated text. ChatGPT is a large language model that was trained on 1.5 billion Reddit conversations. It can generate responses to questions with human-like accuracy, making it an ideal tool for chatbots and other conversational AI applications.
